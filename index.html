                                My name is Quentin Datcher and I'm a 24 year old DC native raised in SE DC. As a youth I attended Kimball Elementry and Sousa Middleschool playing baseball and joining the school band/drumline, thus sparking my love for music. During my highschool years at School Without Walls I joined the crew team and worked for the National Air and Space museum as an explainer.

                                In college, I pursued an electrical engineering degree at the University of Pitsburgh @ Johnstown, however a lack of finances would later force me to drop out in my junior year.

                                <br>
                                Looking for a better source of income, I joined a sales company that was looking to expand to Texas selling cell service to business owners in the Houston area. Through the process I picked up a lot of soft skills and met a lot of great friends however I knew the world of sales wasn't a longterm option for me so when the pandemic hit, I moved back to DC and was lucky to get recommended to my current job at Congressional Cemetery.
